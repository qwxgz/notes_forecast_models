TSlib is an open-source library for deep learning researchers, especially for deep time series analysis.
We provide a neat code base to evaluate advanced deep time series models or develop your model, which covers five mainstream tasks: long- and short-term forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification.

TimesNet as a task-general foundation model for time series analysis. Motivated by the multi-periodicity, TimesNet can ravel out intricate temporal variations by a modular
architecture and capture intraperiod- and interperiod-variations in 2D space by a parameter-efficient
inception block. Experimentally, TimesNet shows great generality and performance in five mainstream analysis tasks.
